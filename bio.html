                    I want to start off by saying I wouldn't be this far if it wasn't for God.  I am a man of faith and all I do is thru Him. 
                     I am also a very artistic and creative individual. I am a huge fan of successful stories and being able to help people strive to become the best version of themseleves. 
                     I'm extremely passionate about bring upon change in communities around the world.  I want to be involved in as much development for the betterment of people.  I love to be in a space where I can express my creative nature and have the platform to do so. 
                     Driven to acheive all that I aspire to accomplish and will not stop until the good LORD says its time. My talents are slim but my drive and determination to help spark a change in the world exceeds many.
